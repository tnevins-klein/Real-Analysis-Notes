# Real Analysis Notes
These are my cumulative efforts to organize my notes on Real Analysis. They only contain a proof of the Algebraic Limit Theorem for functional limits at present, but I plan to begin digitizing and $\LaTeX$ing some of my paper notes from Abbot's *Understanding Analysis*.

Cheers!
